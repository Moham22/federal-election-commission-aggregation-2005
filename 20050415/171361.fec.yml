    have added the word transfer on  Schedule A supporting Line 11(c).       Item
    2A--Schedule B supporting Line 30(b).  Regarding the direct mail processing.  These
    two transactions were on behalf of non-federal candidates and made no mention
    of any federal candidates.  These two transactions have been moved to Line 29.  Item
    2B--Schedule B supporting Line 30(b).  Regarding the newspaper ad slate card info.  Please
    note that payment for the newspaper ad slate card info was for a newspaper ad
    in which 25% of the total at $50.00 a piece was for 2 federal candidates and that
    portion was moved to Schedule E Line 24.   This is the balance of a $400 expenditure
    $100.00 of which is on Schedule E.   Item 3--The independent expenditure schedule
    (Schedule E) has been amended and now provides the election designation.    Item
    4--Schedule E and Schedule F--We hereby confirm that all payments reported on
    Schedule E were done independently of any Federal Candidates.    Item 5--Schedule
    H6--Slate card mailing and slate cards.  Please note two of these transactions
    have been moved to Line 30B and they were both exempt.  The third item on page
    105 was incorrectly described as slate cards.  Please note this was a mail piece
    used for GOTV activity in which no federal candidates were mentioned.  Regarding
    the volunteer phone bank.  Please note that the volunteer phone bank was used
    for GOTV calls and did not mention any federal candidates.    Item 6--Schedule
    H6--The H6 totals are now correct.  Item 7--Schedule B supporting Line 21(b).  Please
    note this was incorrectly described as generic GOTV when in fact this postage
    was for an exempt slate card that referenced John Kerry and Matt Connealy.  Therefore
    the transaction has been moved to Line 30(b).",

      note that payment for the newspaper ad slate card info was for a newspaper ad
      in which 25% of the total at $50.00 a piece was for 2 federal candidates and
      that portion was moved to Schedule E Line 24.   This is the balance of a $400
      expenditure $100.00 of which is on Schedule E.   Item 3--The independent expenditure
      schedule (Schedule E) has been amended and now provides the election designation.    Item
      4--Schedule E and Schedule F--We hereby confirm that all payments reported on
      Schedule E were done independently of any Federal Candidates.    Item 5--Schedule
      H6--Slate card mailing and slate cards.  Please note two of these transactions
      have been moved to Line 30B and they were both exempt.  The third item on page
      105 was incorrectly described as slate cards.  Please note this was a mail piece
      used for GOTV activity in which no federal candidates were mentioned.  Regarding
      the volunteer phone bank.  Please note that the volunteer phone bank was used
      for GOTV calls and did not mention any federal candidates.    Item 6--Schedule
      H6--The H6 totals are now correct.  Item 7--Schedule B supporting Line 21(b).  Please
      note this was incorrectly described as generic GOTV when in fact this postage
      was for an exempt slate card that referenced John Kerry and Matt Connealy.  Therefore
      the transaction has been moved to Line 30(b).

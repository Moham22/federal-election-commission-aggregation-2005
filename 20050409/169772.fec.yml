    reported they were reported on my 1st amendment that is why I got the first notice
    hence my amended 30 day post G and this will be my 2nd amendment. I'm corrected
    the error but now you want to know why the numbers are different.....It doesn't
    make sense. In regards to the schedule A supporting line 17 I accidentally put
    our disbursements in the receipts section. I have corrected the mistake.  We did
    not take any gifts from any companies those receipts really should have been disbursements.
    As for the schedule H4 and the disbursement of $14,000 it was a second payment
    to Sheffield Rooftops this is not a duplicate filling this was a second payment
    that should be on the 30 day post G it falls within the dates and is a second
    payment.  Thank you for your patience and understanding. This can be very confusing!"

    the FEC dated July 25, 2002.  The contribution to Citizens for Eleanor Holmes
    Norton was incorrectly reported in this filing.  I amended the Post General Report
    in 2000 to correctly reflect the $1000 contribution.  I also deleted the memo
    text entries for the Goodlatte for Congress and moran for Congress contributions.  I
    amended the April 2000 Monthly Report to correctly reflect the $500 check that
    was returned by the Goodlatte for congress committee.  I also amendmed the October
    2000 Monthly report to reflect the $500 returned check from the Moran for Congress
    committee.  I think that these amendments correctly reflect all of these transactions.  If

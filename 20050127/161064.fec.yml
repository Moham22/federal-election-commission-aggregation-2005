    value: This report is amended because an error was discovered with SMART PAC's
      bank interest after receiving our 2004 tax information.  An amount of $40.01
      was not added to our PAC reporting software in March of 2004. This amended report
      includes the amount of interest that was omitted in error.  The corrected information
      can be found on the summary page of receipts and disbursements in column A

      have any employee spend more than 25% of their time on federal election activities
      during this month. The payment to the Committee''s non-federal account for Payroll
      was due to lack of funds in the non-federal account. The beginning cash balance

    dated July 6, 2005. The Calculations for Lines 21(a)(i) and 21(a)(ii) of the Detailed
    Summary Page, and the event year-to-date totals for the administrative category
    have been corrected. The MEMO entries for payments to credit card companies on
    Schedule H4 have been corrected to reflect all of the transactions. The original
    report only showed payments in excess of $200.00. The transfers to non-federal
    reported on Schedule B for Line 29 were for Non-federal payroll.The Committee
    did not have any employee spend more than 25% of their time on federal election
    activities during this month. The payment to the Committee's non-federal account
    for Payroll was due to lack of funds in the non-federal account. The beginning
    cash balance of this report is accurate. The ending balance of our 2004 Year End
    Report is incorrect. The Committee is undergoing an internal audit of its accounts,
    and will file omnibus amendments that will correct the year end cash for 2004."

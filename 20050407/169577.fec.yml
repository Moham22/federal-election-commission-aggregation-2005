    addressed by the New Jersey Democratic State Committee''s (C00104471) amendment
    to its amended Year-End (2004) Report..NOTE 1:  Schedule A Line 12 - The committee
    report(s) disclose memos that relate to joint fundraising transfers received from
    DNC General Fund (State Party Victory Fund).  The memos relate to transfers identified
    on Line 12 of reports covering the period from October 1 through December 31.  Memos
    total to amounts that exceed the transferred amounts.  Please note that transfers
    for the related joint fundraising proceeds are not always received from the joint
    fundraising committees during the reporting period.  Proceeds collected by joint
    fundraising committees are not sent immediately to a state party but on a regular
    schedule and may not be paid out corresponding to filing periods; it is not uncommon
    for the joint fundraising committees to provide reportable memo contribution information
    before and/or after related transfers are made..NOTE 2:  Schedule A Missing Information
    - The committee''s report discloses complete information for all contributions
    received and deposited by the committee.  For contributions it solicits the committee''s
    original solicitation clearly advises potential contributors of the requirement
    for contributor information.  Upon receipt of a contribution the committee immediately
    solicits missing information.  The committee also conducts a review for missing
    information prior to the submission of disclosure reports.  The committee has
    confirmed that the joint fundraising committee follows similar procedures and
    exercises best efforts in the collection of contributions that are provided as
    memo entries to the reporting committee.",'

      (11/23/04-12/31/04) Amendment Notes..Below are notes that clarify the issues
      addressed by the New Jersey Democratic State Committee''s (C00104471) amendment
      to its amended Year-End (2004) Report..NOTE 1:  Schedule A Line 12 - The committee
      report(s) disclose memos that relate to joint fundraising transfers received
      from DNC General Fund (State Party Victory Fund).  The memos relate to transfers
      identified on Line 12 of reports covering the period from October 1 through
      December 31.  Memos total to amounts that exceed the transferred amounts.  Please
      note that transfers for the related joint fundraising proceeds are not always
      received from the joint fundraising committees during the reporting period.  Proceeds
      collected by joint fundraising committees are not sent immediately to a state
      party but on a regular schedule and may not be paid out corresponding to filing
      periods; it is not uncommon for the joint fundraising committees to provide
      reportable memo contribution information before and/or after related transfers
      are made..NOTE 2:  Schedule A Missing Information - The committee''s report
      discloses complete information for all contributions received and deposited
      by the committee.  For contributions it solicits the committee''s original solicitation
      clearly advises potential contributors of the requirement for contributor information.  Upon
      receipt of a contribution the committee immediately solicits missing information.  The
      committee also conducts a review for missing information prior to the submission
      of disclosure reports.  The committee has confirmed that the joint fundraising
      committee follows similar procedures and exercises best efforts in the collection
      of contributions that are provided as memo entries to the reporting committee.'
